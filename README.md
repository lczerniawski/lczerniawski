<p>
I am a versatile and highly skilled software engineer with expertise in a wide range of technologies and principles. My proficiency spans the .NET stack, including C#, MSSQL, Razor Pages, Entity Framework, and web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and Git. I am well-versed in DevOps principles, particularly in CI/CD and Azure DevOps Pipelines, and possess architectural knowledge encompassing design patterns, architectural patterns, API design, and cloud architecture best practices.

I hold Microsoft certifications in data, cloud technology, and AI/ML, underlining my dedication to continuous learning and mastery in these domains. My Agile and Scrum experience, coupled with multilingual capabilities in English and Polish, enable me to collaborate effectively with diverse teams and stakeholders.

In my professional journey, I have excelled in feature development and finding technical solutions to meet business needs. Code quality is a top priority for me, as I actively participate in code reviews and contribute to the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Development (DEV) team, driving efficiency and excellence in software development. I have a history of close collaboration with architects and provide critical support for local development environments.

Outside of work, I am a Formula 1 enthusiast and an eager learner, currently pursuing AI studies at the University of Liverpool. My passion for technology and diverse skill set make me a valuable asset to any development team.
